CREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Level 1:  

Bank XYZ has approached us to build a credit card management system. They have ‘n’ number of customers and each customer can have a maximum of 5 credit cards. The customer needs to have the ability to deposit, spend and view balance on each of his cards through a secret pin for each card. The customer should not be able to use the credit card if PIN is incorrect. The customer must have the ability to close/block his cards and the bank must have the same privileges too. The Bank must have the ability to see list of customers and also the card details of each customer. 

Level 2:  

The customer must be able to purchase items(create 2-3 items with different price) and that should update the balance on his credit card accordingly. The bank must have the ability to retrieve all the blocked or closed card details in a separate file.  

Level 3:   

There can be many banks and all banks will have their own credit cards. A customer can have accounts in multiple banks and can use multiple credit cards. The maximum number of credit card per customer must still be 5. Credit cards can be of different types and each type will have its own spending limit (Platinum, Diamond, Gold cards)
